# Random-Students-API
Techdegree Project 5

Welcome to the 'AWESOME STARTUP EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY'!

This project retrieves completely random 12 employees and their specific data from an API database, and displays it to a webpage. 

Employees are displayed on 'cards' that show their picture, first and last name, email, city and state.

You are able to also dynamically search for employees by first name, last name,full name (and will begin to update as a key with an included letter is found).

Lastly, employee cards are 'clickable'. Once clicked, a modal opens up with some additional data for that particular employee.

Improvement and refactoring of code coming in future updates!

Lastly, some aesthetic improvements have been made - added/changes schedule below:
